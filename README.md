# Hive Mind Scoreboard
**What is Hive Mind?**

The game of Hive Mind, by Richard Garfield, is a board game where players fill in lists
of answers that match a category.  It's similar to many old parlor games except instead
of being rewarded for unique answers, you are punished, and are instead rewarded for
answers that abide by the "hive mind".

This application is created just for fun and is meant to help score a game of Hive Mind,
potentially between players that are playing remotely or over video conference.

A demo page is up at https://rickodonnell.github.io/hivemind/
